## What's new in TypeScript 2.7?

A repo of a few small code samples I threw together for [a presentation](http://www.jasonkillian.com/presentations/new-in-ts27.pdf)
at [TypeScriptNYC](https://www.meetup.com/TypeScriptNYC/) showing new features of TypeScript 2.7.

#### How to use this repo

For the most part, each `.ts` file in this repo is meant to be viewed in VSCode using TS2.6 and TS2.7.
You should see differences in errors and types as you switch between the two versions of TypeScript.

This repo intentionally depends on TypeScript 2.6.
Your version of VSCode, if up to date, should have a newer version of TypeScript built in.
It should be easy then to [switch between the two different versions of TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions) and see what changes:
